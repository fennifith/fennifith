### Open Source

I've written a [wide range](https://jfenn.me/projects/) of software for various reasons - to suit my needs, experiment with new functionality, or just [mess around](https://jfenn.me/blog/2018-09-25-Exceptional-Traveler/) for fun.

Much of it is buggy, inefficient, out of date, or otherwise incomplete - but I like to [open source](https://jfenn.me/community/) it regardless so anyone can see what I'm working on. Generally, it's a lot more interesting to interact with other people and collaborate on improving my work.

If you need help with the contributing process in any of my projects, have any questions or confusion, or want to get feedback before a contribution, please don't hesitate to [get in touch!](https://jfenn.me/contact/)
